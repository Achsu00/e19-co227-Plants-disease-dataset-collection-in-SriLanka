## Introduction

Welcome to the Plant Diseases Data Collection and API Development project! This repository houses a curated dataset of plant diseases and a user-friendly API that provides easy access to this invaluable information. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of agriculture and plant health, this project aims to empower you with accurate data and tools to address plant diseases effectively.

## Problem and Solution
In Sri Lanka, a significant portion of the population engages in gardening, whether for personal pleasure or sustenance. However, many individuals lack the expertise to identify plant diseases, which can result in the deterioration of their plants' health. Without timely intervention, these diseases can spread and devastate entire gardens or crops. As a result, there is a need for a user-friendly and accessible solution that empowers gardeners to quickly and accurately identify plant diseases.

Our project aims to develop a mobile application that assists gardeners in Sri Lanka in identifying and managing plant diseases. By utilizing image recognition technology and a comprehensive plant disease database, the application will allow users to capture photos of their plants showing symptoms of disease. The app will then analyze the images and provide users with information about the likely disease, along with recommended steps for treatment and prevention.
